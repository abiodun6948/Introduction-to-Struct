Student Recording i/o reading
A struct groups multiple related variables under one name.
This is useful for representing complex data like a student record, employee details, or a product catalog.
In C++, you can use structs to store related data, file I/O to read external data, and arrays (or std::vector) to manage multiple records efficiently.
